Detective Harriet Blue is a good cop on the run, and now there's a price on her head. But Harriet is not the only one who's gone rogue. A known killer roams free, searching for his next victim, and leaving a grisly trail to the scene of a long-abandoned cold case.
As the police race to save one of their own, Harriet edges toward the dark side. At stake are her innocence--and her freedom.
